                    <p> ThoughWorks Studios has released an ebook titled “How do you estimate on an Agile project?” where they explore common approaches and their adaptions from real-world projects.  The book is comprised of several authors, most notably Martin Fowler. In this ebook they discuss why teams estimate, different methods that teams use to estimate, and provide a [&#8230;]<img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=cecilgwilliams.wordpress.com&#038;blog=31880146&#038;post=294&#038;subd=cecilgwilliams&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" /></p>

                    <p> Last fall I was at my daughter’s college homecoming celebration where I saw an Action Flipbooks booth.  Seeing them record a short video of you and then create a flipbook for you on the spot led me to an idea. One of the things that I like most about agile software development is the feedback.  [&#8230;]<img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=cecilgwilliams.wordpress.com&#038;blog=31880146&#038;post=277&#038;subd=cecilgwilliams&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" /></p>

                    <p> It is amazing just how far I have come in providing value from what I do as an IT consultant.  I started my career as a Nuclear Engineer.  So I was trained to design, plan, and document everything I did.  As I transitioned into software development, I naturally gravitated toward those same disciplines.  I found [&#8230;]<img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=cecilgwilliams.wordpress.com&#038;blog=31880146&#038;post=163&#038;subd=cecilgwilliams&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" /></p>

                    <p> If you haven’t heard of Git or don’t understand why you should use it, checkout the talk given by the author to Google (Torvalds, 2007).  Git is an excellent version control tool for agile software development.  But many of us may not have the luxury of using Git because our company has deemed that we [&#8230;]<img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=cecilgwilliams.wordpress.com&#038;blog=31880146&#038;post=128&#038;subd=cecilgwilliams&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" /></p>

                    <p> You probably have heard of continuous integration.  But have you heard of continuous deployment or continuous delivery?  So what&#8217;s the difference? While continuous deployment is concerned about getting changes into production as fast as possible, continuous delivery is concerned with getting feedback on changes as fast as possible by deploying into a production-like environment.
